The armv8-rpi3-linux-gnueabihf cross-toolchain was created with crosstool-NG. It is adapted for kernel 4.14 and uses glibc 2.28. This allows the toolchain to work with Raspbian Buster. 

The configuration used to build the toolchain is in the associate armv8-rpi3-linux-gnueabihf.config file. It can also be extract by executing: $./armv8-rpi3-linux-gnueabihf/bin/armv8-rpi3-linux-gnueabihf-ct-ng.config
